Taimaponics is an Angular 2 + Node.js + Arduino hydroponics controller intended for use with various sensors and relays to automatically and remotely manage your indoor garden environment. It is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi 2 or 3 as a master, with an Arduino connected via serial as a slave. The Node application sends commands to the Arduino to retrieve sensor data, toggle 120v relays on and off to control light cycles, fans, water pumps and more.

Electrical and wiring diagrams are forthcoming.
